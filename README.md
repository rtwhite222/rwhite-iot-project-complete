Created to be used in conjunction with the Mako Server. The server can be installed at
https://makoserver.net/download/windows/
for windows machines.

This is a non-commercial usage of Mako Server and intended for educational purposes

After downloading the server, insert the **ProjectApplication** document into the saved MakoServer folder just downloaded, 
or whatever name you decided to give it.

If you use the command prompt to access the MakoServer document after saving it, you can use the command

mako -l::ProjectApplication

to access the project's website.

On start, a database will be created with a root user in place, log in using 'root' and 'COM810' as the password.
